Dataset: Raleigh, NC - 2016 Resident Survey 
https://opendurham.nc.gov/explore/dataset/2016-with-county-and-city/
735 residents completed the survey 
192 survey items 
Survey assessed citizen satisfaction with the delivery of government services

Problem
Determine government services that citizens are not satisfied with 
Pinpoint problem areas to recommend that the NC government focus on improving

What I learned
In general, residents are satisfied with government services that they receive (residents mostly report that they are satisfied or very satisfied with the services provided) 
Public transportation, parking, and availability of government information are potential services in need of improvement (these services were ranked most poorly across residents)
In general, each district is equally satisfied with its services
Note that District 1 was ranked more poorly than the top performing districts (1, 2, and outlying areas); if this trend continues, District 1 may deserve more attention from the NC government in the future
Dissatisfaction with public transportation and parking may be linked to geographical regions
Dissatisfaction with public transportation is higher outside of the county center
Dissatisfaction with parking is higher near the county center

What I did
Selected a dataset that most closely resembles one type of DataRobot’s HR data (i.e., survey measures of satisfaction)
Reduced data into meaningful categories of services using data-driven techniques
Extracted 8 categories of government services
Visualized satisfaction for each of those categories and whether satisfaction differed by geographical location 
Analyzed differences in satisfaction 

How I did it
Reduced data (R) - 
Using Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), I reduced a dataset of 192 variables into 8 meaningful categories of government services. Unlike other forms of dimension reduction, EFA can provide meaningful explanatory information about a dataset. This method will likely be important for better understanding DataRobot’s expansive HR data by reducing that data into fewer meaningful categories and allowing stakeholders to more precisely and accurately direct their efforts toward improvement. 
Extract categories (R)
After identifying 8 categories using EFA, I created aggregate measures of satisfaction for these categories.  
Visualized satisfaction (Tableau) 
I created a plot of satisfaction by government service to identify any problem areas (i.e., which services show substantially less satisfaction) (See “1. Satisfaction” in dashboard)
I created a plot of satisfaction by district to identify whether any specific districts were performing substantially more poorly than any other district (See “3. Satisfaction by District” in dashboard)
I plotted satisfaction by geographical location to see whether any specific geographical area was performing poorly with respect to a certain government service (See “2. Satisfaction - Durham, NC” in dashboard)
Analyzed differences (R)
Using ANOVA and post-hoc tests, I analyzed whether there were any categories or districts that had significantly lower ratings of satisfaction
